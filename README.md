# iMessage GOTV Stickers
Whether an “I Voted” sticker worn out of the voting booth or a candidate’s slogan on your bumper, stickers have long been an good friend of democracy.

With iOS 10, it’s now possible to have stickers in iMessages, so let’s make a sticker pack to Get Out the Vote.

The idea is that this will be a 100% non-partisan GOTV. I’d love to have something published in time for [National Voter Registration Day](http://nationalvoterregistrationday.org) on September 26. 

I’m still working out the details, but if you’re interested in contributing drop me a line here, [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/noahmanger), or [over email](mailto:noah.manger@gmail.com).
